# Content Recommendation App

This project is aimed at developing a content recommendation system based on user search history, preferences, and ratings. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import data from Kaggle dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook environment.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the imported data using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.pyplot for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning techniques to model user preferences and behavior.
- **Content Recommendation**: Develop a recommendation system based on user search history, preferences, and ratings.
